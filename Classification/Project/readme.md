# Iris Flower Classification

The Iris dataset was used in <b>R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems</b>, and can also be found on the <b>UCI Machine Learning Repository</b>.

The dataset consists of three iris species with 50 samples each along with certain properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The data is structured into different columns namely:
1. Id
2. Sepal length
3. Sepal width
4. Petal length
5. Petal width
6. Species

All the dimensions in cm

<b>Task : Create a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species are already known, so that we can predict the species for the new irises that she has found. Implement the same using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.</b><br>
