# Clustering

Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning in which objects are grouped into clusters in such a way that objects with most similarities remain into one group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group. Cluster analysis finds the common features between the data objects and segregates them as per the presence and absence of those features.
